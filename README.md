- 👋 Hi, I’m @WindFish411
- 👀 After developing an interest in programming I have taught myself a lot about programming, and continue to do so on a daily basis. 
- 🌱 I have completed a tournament tracking application writte in C# with a SQL database. After this I wanted some experience with an interpreted language, so I got a certification in Python programming (PCEP - Python Institute). Additionally, I am interested in cloud programming, so I got the entry level AWS certification (CCP). Currently, I am working on learning front end web development through an open source project called the Odin Project. It is a very good program for those with little experience in web development. Look it up!
- I have recently started working on coding puzzles as well (Leetcode) in order to become a better programmer and better prepare myself for job application tests. 
- 💞️ I have started the job search, as it has been about two years since I started learning programming and getting that first job is my logical next step forward. I have a couple of certications under my belt, as well as a full program, but I do not intend to stop there. I will continue to work on projects and learn until I'm too busy working as a programmer to keep up!
