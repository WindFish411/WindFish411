- 👋 Hi, I’m @WindFish411
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things! I've been playing around with all kinds of free software like VS, SQL, Audacity, Unity, and others. On a less professional note I love video games, guitar, hiking, lifting, and hanging out with friends. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL & C#, but I am considering starting on a new project. I hear AWS offers free training, and I love free training. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for my first job in development. I have completed a first project, and I'm polishing off my resume and online presence. Once that's done, on to a new project!
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me at wtstrunk1@gmail.com.
